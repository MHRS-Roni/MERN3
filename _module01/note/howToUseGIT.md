    #Version Control
        *History of changes : Suppose,
                                you have a large scale project..there are ton of codes..you cann't always remember and track this huge amount of code.if you modify something and yuo

    #Code Management
        *Multiple version of Code : Suppose,
                                      you have a code that is already running and you want to improve that code.but if you change the source code it could hamper the running code or you may make it worse than improving it.So here's the sollution you can make a copy of the current code and improve the copy code.if you do something wrong in the code it will not hamper the service and won't make any problem in source code.it is 100% safe now...here copy is branch...
        *Merging and creating new : then,
                                    if you are sure you have done what you wanted then you can merge the code to the default code and you have successfuly improved the source code without hamparing the service..branch merge make it happen..
