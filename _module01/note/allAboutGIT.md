--uses and benefits of git
        
        *Multiple version of Code : Suppose,
                                      you have a source code that is already running on a server and you want to improve that code.but if you change the source code it could hamper the running code or you may make it worse than improving it.So here's the sollution you can make a copy of the current code and improve the copy code.if you do something wrong in the copy code it will not hamper the service and won't make any problem in source code.it is 100% safe now...here copy means branch...
        *History of changes       :  When,
                                      you have a large scale project..there are ton of codes..you cann't always remember and track this huge amount of code.if you modify something or try new feature there is change that you may make the whole code unrunable.but if you use git you are safe from this kind of things,you can always take a snapshot of your code and then change the code if something bad happen in code you can always revert to previous code that you have snaped..snap can be taken by commit..

        *Code review                :After,
                                       you have write your code you may want to recheck and reconsider that if are really sure that you want to deploy your new version of code in server.You can also recheck the whole process how you have done the whole project.You can compare your previous code with the new code...by deffer
        *Merging                    :Then,
                                      if you are sure you have done what you wanted then you can merge the code to the source code and you have successfuly improved the source code without hamparing the service..git make it happen..
        *Distributed Development &
            Collaboration           :If,
                                      You are working with a team without git you have to collect code from every member frequently by mail or any other means.But here is a huge change of misunderstanding and miscommunication and make the whole process of development hell.But with git you can have your own repository and a centerl repository.In your own repository you can always get the newest version of your project code from the main repository and you can always push your modified code when you are satisfied with our code.Then you can merge every branch of code and make the project whole..
        *Backup and restore         :Suppose,
                                      The whole project was somehow deleted from your  computer ,you can always get the code from your commited git and remote repository if you have one.But what will happen if the main server code was deleted somehow you can get the whole project from remote repository or from any other developers codespace who is working on the project.He can push the whole project to the main server.
        *Open source                :It is,
                                      open source tools,You can use it free and you can always modify it according to your need.There is no one to stop you from doing so.
